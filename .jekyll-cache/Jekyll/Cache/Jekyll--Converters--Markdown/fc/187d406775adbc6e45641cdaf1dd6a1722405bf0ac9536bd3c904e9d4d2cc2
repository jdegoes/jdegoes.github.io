I"·<p>I know what youâ€™re thinking, because Iâ€™m thinking it too: thereâ€™s <em>way</em> too much â€œloveâ€ and â€œpeaceâ€ on the Internet these days.</p>

<p>There are too many people refusing to feel threatened by their differences. Too many uniting as members of the human race, and working together for a common good.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you can do something about it. By studying numerous flame wars over more than 20 years, Iâ€™ve discovered the ultimate secret to pissing people off.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s really quite simple: just say something <em>threatening</em>. Make people feel bad about who they are, so they, in turn, can become defensive and angry at you for your attacks.</p>

<p>If that sounds easier said than done, youâ€™re right! Not to worry, Iâ€™ve distilled all my learnings into five reliable (if somewhat strange) tricks you can use to incite hatred like a pro.</p>

<p>Study these tactics well, and apply them with reckless abandon. Through dedication and perseverance, you can help turn the tides and usher in the Internetâ€™s next era of hatemongering!</p>

<h3 id="1-avoid-facts-like-the-plague">1. Avoid Facts Like the Plague</h3>

<p>Every master of incitement knows that <em>facts</em> make poor fodder for inflaming emotions.</p>

<p>Facts are objective statements about reality, like <em>â€œJoe tried to sell us a used car with cracks in the engine.â€</em> No one disputes facts, which is why theyâ€™re called facts, so the power they have for making people angry is very low.</p>

<p>Facts are <em>absolutely toxic</em> to hatemongering: avoid them at all costs!</p>

<p>Nonetheless, by subtly modifying a fact, you can turn it into a <em>partial truth</em>, which can incite <em>far more</em> hatred than a complete falsehood. Indeed, the majority of <em>all</em> inflammatory language achieves its sting by masquerading as fact!</p>

<p>For example, we can modify the above fact, and pass it off as â€œfactualâ€, by stating: <em>â€œUsed car salespeople are sleazy scumbags who sell defective automobilesâ€</em>.</p>

<p>In the tricks that follow, Iâ€™ll give you some concrete ways you can take factual statements, and alter them in a way that inflames.</p>

<h3 id="2-generalize-statements-from-individuals-to-groups">2. Generalize Statements from Individuals to Groups</h3>

<p>One easy way to fictionalize information is to take a statement thatâ€™s true for <em>someone</em>, and say or imply that itâ€™s true of <em>everyone</em> in some group to which the individual belongs.</p>

<p>For example, letâ€™s take this statement of fact: <em>â€œCEO so-and-so laid off 4000 employees to cut costs while pressuring the board of directors for a $50m annual bonus.â€</em></p>

<p>Thatâ€™s a fact, and pretty useless to us. No one can dispute it (not even the named CEO!), and it doesnâ€™t really make anyone feel bad about themselves.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s change the statement to talk about CEOs like theyâ€™re an individual: <em>â€œCEOs layoff employees to save costs while massively inflating their bonuses.â€</em></p>

<p>This statement is no longer a fact, even though it still contains some truth. Now itâ€™s potentially threatening to any CEO who feels the above characterization impugns on their character.</p>

<p>The â€œsome truthâ€ part is important. For maximum effect, you should make sure thereâ€™s at least <em>one</em> individual in the group for which the statement is true. This lets you claim your statement is â€œgenerally trueâ€ and just has some exceptions that â€œprove the ruleâ€.</p>

<p>More examples to start some flame wars:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>The tech industry doesnâ€™t give a shit about diversity;</em></li>
  <li><em>Democrats are socalists;</em></li>
  <li><em>Atheists are mean-spirited, elitist blowhards.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>See the power of this technique?</p>

<p>The other name for this technique, of course, is <em>stereotyping</em>. Technically, itâ€™s a fallacious way of reasoning called <em>False Analogy</em> thatâ€™s indispensable to hatemongerers everywhere.</p>

<h3 id="3-objectify-your-feelings">3. Objectify Your Feelings</h3>

<p>A statement like, <em>â€œWhen you called me a pig, it hurt my feelings,â€</em> is a subjective statement about the contents of your mind.</p>

<p>No rational person would question your description of your own mind, since no one has any more insight into what youâ€™re feeling than you do. Very few would even become <em>upset</em> with you for describing the way things make you feel. Itâ€™s just not very <em>threatening</em>.</p>

<p>To <em>really</em> piss people off, you can take <em>subjective</em> statements about your mind, and make them sound like <em>objective</em> facts about the world <em>outside</em> your mind.</p>

<p>For example, instead of saying <em>â€œYou hurt my feelings,â€</em>, describe the other person: <em>â€œYouâ€™re mean.â€</em> The statement, <em>â€œYouâ€™re meanâ€</em> implies a whole host of things about the other personâ€™s mental state and past behaviors, and will threaten them unless they revel in the idea of being â€œmeanâ€.</p>

<p>Or go one step further, and take a subjective fact like, <em>â€œI like donating to the Humane Society,â€</em> which is totally non-threatening, and turn it into a law of physics thatâ€™s true about the objective world: <em>â€œAll people should donate to the Humane Society.â€</em></p>

<h3 id="4-use-loaded-language">4. Use Loaded Language</h3>

<p>Words arenâ€™t neutral. They usually have positive or negative connotations. You can take advantage of this by using words that have negative connotations (however slight!).</p>

<p>For example, instead of stating the fact, <em>â€œHumans change the environment,â€</em> replace the neutral word <em>change</em> with the negative word <em>damage</em>.</p>

<p>The word <em>damage</em> implies a â€œbadâ€ kind of change, which begs the question, Bad to whom? If we explicitly stated whom, the statement would become factual again: <em>â€œSo-and-so doesnâ€™t like the way humans are changing the environment.â€</em></p>

<p>This factual statement has no inflammatory power, so instead, we leave it vague by using the word <em>damage</em>, without specifying the agent or agents to whom the change is considered â€œbadâ€.</p>

<p>Incidentally, all forms of name-calling are examples of this trick, because they rely on the power of negative connotations to imply someone or something is â€œbadâ€.</p>

<h3 id="5-eliminate-shades-of-gray">5. Eliminate Shades of Gray</h3>

<p>As a kid watching Star Wars, I always wondered what the Empire ever did to warrant a galactic war. Excluding Darth Vaderâ€™s direct reports, life <em>seemed</em> to be pretty good for the average grunt on either side of the war.</p>

<p>Now I know humans are inherently tribalistic. We have a natural inclination to group everyone into â€œusâ€ or â€œthemâ€ (our tribe or some other tribe). Light Side or Dark Side.</p>

<p>You can take advantage of this innate tribalism by casting all people as â€œgoodâ€ or â€œbadâ€.</p>

<p>People are either utterly corrupt, selfish, diabolical, scheming, murderous sociopaths, or theyâ€™re on your side. There are no shades of gray, only black and white. Everyone who disagrees with you is one of â€œthemâ€, on the Dark Side, and not worthy of the air they breath.</p>

<p>Take that philosophy with you to the Internet, and youâ€™ll cultivate hatred better than Darth Vader himself.</p>

<h2 id="go-forth-and-flame">Go Forth and Flame</h2>

<p>With this bag of tricks under your belt, youâ€™re ready to bring some good olâ€™ fashioned hatred into this world.</p>

<p>Go forth on Twitter, Internet forums, Facebook, wherever else you hang out online, and leverage what youâ€™ve learned here to incite hatred and piss off everyone.</p>

<p>And remember, donâ€™t forget to retweet, like, share, and link to others who are bravely committed to our cause. A simple retweet of an inflammatory remark takes almost <em>no</em> time, but the effects can be felt around the world.</p>

<p>Good luck, and see you in the Internetâ€™s next era of hatemongering!</p>
